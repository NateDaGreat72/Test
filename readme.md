# Nathaniel Templeton
# Led by the Spirit of God
# May not be our best day, but we'll come back stronger
# Seven times I may stumble, but He will pick me up again
# Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so
# Time is running short... 
# Find your Savior before it's too late
# Jesus loves you no matter what
# Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self-Control
